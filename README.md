This crate supports reading virtual memory maps from another process - and supports
Linux, OSX, Windows, and FreeBSD operating systems.

Example:

``` rust
use proc_maps::get_process_maps;

let maps = get_process_maps(pid)?;
for map in maps {
    println!("Filename {:?} Address {} Size {}", map.filename(), map.start(), map.size());
}

```
